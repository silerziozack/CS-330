#How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first thoroughly understanding the problem I am trying to solve. I break down the requirements into smaller, manageable components and prioritize them based on their importance and dependency. I then create a high-level architecture and design detailed modules, ensuring they are modular and scalable. I often use design patterns and best practices to guide my design choices.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project has enhanced my ability to think critically and solve complex problems creatively. I've developed a better understanding of user experience design, making my interfaces more intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, I've honed my skills in creating maintainable and scalable architectures.

How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I start by clearly defining the problem and outlining the requirements. I then create a plan, breaking down the project into smaller tasks. I write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices such as version control, code reviews, and testing. I also stay open to feedback and continuously refactor and improve the code.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene, I adopted new strategies such as using advanced graphics libraries and tools for rendering. I also utilized optimization techniques to improve performance and ensure smooth rendering. Implementing shaders and learning about lighting and textures were also new areas I explored.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a big factor.  I needed to make sure my skill set matched the type of scene I was trying to create.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code has become more structured and efficient. I have learned the importance of thorough planning, consistent documentation, and regular testing. My code quality has improved as I adopted best practices and coding standards, making my development process smoother and more predictable.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
